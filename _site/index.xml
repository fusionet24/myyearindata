<p>Welcome back to a long overdue blog rebuild. I’ve attempted to rebuild this blog 3 times so far in the last 3 years. So finally I have finished it (if you’re reading this).</p>
<p>A lot has happened in the last few years but first I want to just get on with writing code and analysing data.</p>
<p>If you’re not familar yet, I run a (sometimes daily) Databricks Tips, tricks and hacks twitter account. That is followed by quite a few databricks people. I would recommend following it or signing up the even less frequent newsletter :)</p>
