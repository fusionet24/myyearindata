I write a few other places, the [DailyDatabricks Twitter](http://twitter.com/dailydatabricks) and my [codementor blog](https://www.codementor.io/@fusionet24/create-your-own-magic-commands-in-databricks-1w8y1pdpqe)

The Aim of this blog is to capture knowledge on technical subjects while also allowing for interesting and often pointless data exploration.

**It's supposed to be fun, that is all!**
