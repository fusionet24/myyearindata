This is a response to my friend and colleague Ust and his recent blog post “On Perspective.” (I highly recommend reading his post first for context.)

Ust, your piece got me thinking deeply about how we form and challenge our perspectives. You make a compelling case that our understanding of truth is limited by our viewpoint, and that broadening perspective requires staying open-minded and curious. I wholeheartedly agree. In fact, one line of yours really resonated with me:

> Ultimately, we can only gain perspective through openness and curiosity. If we’re not open, any additional perspective will be closed to us. If we’re not curious, we’ll never find additional perspectives.

While I agree with your general premise, I’d like to add my own reflections.

I’m drawing on things I’ve read and personal experiences over the years, but by no means as a self proclaimed expert in these. So welcome anyone readings feedback.

In reading your post, I also recalled your earlier essay on truth. You argued, if I remember right, that there’s a difference between objective truth and the truths we each hold from our perspective. In my younger years, I put a lot of stock in the idea of a single, objective Truth – the notion that with enough logic or data, we could all see the same reality.

However, as I (hopefully) grew more emotionally mature, I started to appreciate the idea of personal truth, the truth for me, shaped by my experiences and perceptions, even if it isn’t universally “objective.” This shift in my thinking was basically an acceptance of something akin to critical realism – the stance that an external reality does exist, but our understanding of it is inevitably filtered through our limited observations and mental models. In other words, the observable world we each see is not the entire real world, only our interpretation of it.

Embracing that idea required some humility. It meant admitting that my perspective is just one among many, and that I could be wrong or incomplete. It reminds me of a famous Bertrand Russell quote that deserves more credit in our current era:

> “The whole problem with the world is that fools and fanatics are always so certain of themselves, but wiser people so full of doubts.” – Bertrand Russell

Reading your work, I see you championing that same sort of humble curiosity. Keeping a curious, open mind is absolutely paramount if we want a fuller version of truth.

In your “On Perspective” post, you highlight that none of us has a monopoly on truth and that we gain so much when we invite other viewpoints in. I couldn’t agree more. Your emphasis on openness and doubt echoes wisdom from philosophy and science (after all, progress often starts by doubting what we think we know). I find myself nodding along: yes! We should seek out those other perspectives, even if it means questioning our own convictions.
