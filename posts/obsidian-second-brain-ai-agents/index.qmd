## The Productivity Tool Graveyard

Let's be honest if you're reading this, you've probably tried at least three note-taking systems in the last few years. The pattern is always the same. You see something new, you try it, then watch it slowly become another abandoned graveyard of good intentions.

Notion. LogSeq. Bear. Apple Notes. OneNote. Back to pen and paper. Then back to digital because your handwriting is terrible (👀) and you can't search paper anyway.

The uncomfortable question lurks beneath all this tool rotation. Are we optimizing our work, or are we just avoiding it? Is building the perfect productivity system a form of productive procrastination?

As a consultant running my own business, I'm always busy. Context switching is the job. I need to remember who said what, which client has which constraints, what decisions were made six months ago. My brain can't hold all of it perfectly. Something has to give.

Late 2023, I watched a video that made me reconsider everything.

## Some context from Stashpad to Obsidian
In [2023, I wrote about Stashpad](../tools-for-consultants/index.qmd) as my note-taking tool of choice. It worked well. Quick capture, good organization, markdown support, timestamping for reviewing historical knowledge. For a year, it was exactly what I needed.

But Stashpad was fundamentally a storage system for thoughts. A filing cabinet with good search. Useful, but passive.

Then I came across [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbsAQSIKQXk) about Obsidian as a thinking environment. Not just notes, but a system for connecting ideas, building knowledge over time, and creating structure from chaos.

What resonated wasn't the feature list. It was the mental model shift. Stashpad stored information. Obsidian promised to help me think.

So I made the switch. Migrated my notes, rebuilt my workflows, learned a new system from scratch. It wasn't instant. It wasn't easy. Some things were objectively worse for the first few weeks. Quick capture was slower. The learning curve was real.

But the difference became clear once I stopped trying to use Obsidian like Stashpad. I wasn't just taking notes anymore. I was building a knowledge system.

## What Obsidian Actually Delivers (Not a Sales Pitch)

Let's skip the marketing speak. Below you can see what I use, and more importantly, what actually works. If you're not interested you can skip that part...
::: {.callout-note collapse="true" }

### Daily Scheduling and Time Blocking

I use Obsidian to structure my entire day. Every morning, I create a daily note with time blocks for focused work, meetings, and context switches. It's not magic. It's just having a single place where my schedule lives alongside my notes about what I'm working on.

When I finish a meeting, I write notes directly into obsidian. When I need to remember what I was doing last Tuesday, I open that day's note. Simple, but effective.

This requires discipline and focus. If you know me well enough I kinda suck at focus but obsidian does force my hand. The tool doesn't make you organized. It just gives you a canvas to be organized on.

![Daily note with time blocking - YOUR SCREENSHOT HERE](images/daily-note-screenshot.png)

### Reflection Roll-Ups (Daily → Weekly → Monthly → Yearly)

This is where things get interesting. At the end of each day, I write a brief reflection. What got done, what didn't, what I learned. Every week, I review my daily notes and write a weekly summary. Monthly summaries roll up the weeks. Yearly (a new thing) reviews synthesize the months.

The pattern recognition that emerges is useful. You start seeing which types of work drain you, where you're spending time versus where you said you wanted to spend time. The disconnect between intention and reality becomes stark.

### The Knowledge Graph

The knowledge graph is the most overhyped useful feature of Obsidian. Marketing materials show these beautiful interconnected webs of knowledge. In practice, most people's graphs look like a tangled mess with a few dense clusters and a lot of orphaned nodes.

But when it works, it works. I'll be writing notes about a client architecture decision, link to a previous project with similar constraints, and suddenly remember a conversation from six months ago that's directly relevant. The graph doesn't think for you, but it does surface connections your brain might not make on its own.

![Knowledge graph visualization - YOUR SCREENSHOT HERE](images/knowledge-graph-screenshot.png)

### Excalidraw Integration

I think in diagrams. Architecture sketches, data flow doodles, rough conceptual models. Excalidraw lets me draw directly in Obsidian, embed those drawings in notes, and iterate on technical ideas without switching tools.

I'll sketch out an architecture during a call, refine it later, then augment the diagram with written notes about constraints and decisions. It's not about creating perfect diagrams. It's about externalizing thought.

::: callout-note
## What Obsidian Isn't

It's not a project management tool. It's not a team collaboration platform. It's not going to organize your life automatically. It's a blank canvas with really good linking and search. Everything else is what you build on top of it.

If you're looking for structure handed to you, look elsewhere. If you want the flexibility to build your own structure, this might work.

## The Uncomfortable Question: Do Productivity Systems Actually Work?

Here's where I need to be honest. I've used Obsidian seriously for about 14 months now. I've built elaborate systems. I've refined workflows. I've spent hours organizing my vault.

And I keep asking myself: Is this making me more productive, or does it just feel like I'm more productive?

The energy redirection problem is real. Every hour spent building the perfect tagging system is an hour not spent doing actual work. Every morning spent organizing yesterday's notes is time not spent on today's priorities. The system itself becomes work.

So does it actually work? My personal assessment after 14 months:

**What works:** - Cognitive offloading is real. Getting information out of my head and into a searchable system creates genuine mental space. I'm not trying to remember everything anymore. I'm trusting the system to remember for me. - Context switching costs drop. When I move between projects, I can reload context quickly by reading yesterday's notes instead of spending 20 minutes trying to remember where I was. - Long-term pattern recognition matters. The weekly and monthly reviews force me to step back and see trends I'd miss in the day-to-day chaos.

**What doesn't work:** - The time investment is significant. I spend 30-60 minutes per day on note-taking, organizing, and reviewing. That's real overhead. - The system is fragile. Miss a week and everything starts degrading. The value is in the habit, and habits are hard. - You can't build the perfect system upfront. I've rebuilt major parts of my vault three times. Each time I thought I had it figured out, I discovered new problems.

**What I've learned:** - Build slowly. Don't try to create the perfect system on day one. Start with daily notes. Add features only when you need them. - Running a business with multiple side projects creates cognitive overload that's genuinely hard to manage without external support. For my context, this system is essential. For someone with a single focused job? Probably overkill.

## The Productivity System Trap

The best productivity system is the one you actually use. If you spend more time organizing notes than creating value from them, you're doing it wrong. I've been there. Multiple times.

The goal isn't a beautiful vault. It's doing better work. If the system doesn't serve that goal, the system is wrong.
:::

And then I started adding AI agents into the mix. That changed everything.

## When AI Agents Tip the Value Equation

Here's where things get interesting. Obsidian as a second brain is useful. Obsidian with AI agents solving problems in your vault? That's transformative.

The core problem with any knowledge management system is overhead. Building it takes time. Maintaining it takes time. Organizing it, tagging it, keeping it current, making sure you can find things later. All of that is necessary work, but it's not the work you're trying to do. It's meta-work.

AI agents solve the ROI problem. They don't replace thinking. They handle the cognitive janitorial work that makes the system sustainable.

I run a local AI server. More control over my data, no API costs for constant queries, and the ability to fine-tune models for my specific workflows. The tradeoff is setup complexity and needing decent hardware. For me, it's worth it.

![Local AI server setup - YOUR SCREENSHOT HERE](images/local-ai-server.png)

I've built four specialized agents, each solving a specific problem in my vault. Not one general-purpose AI trying to do everything. Four narrow, opinionated, boring agents doing repetitive tasks really well.

This isn't sci-fi agentic AI hype. This is practical application of the patterns I've been [exploring in my work on agentic systems](../agentic-patterns-right-now-2025/index.qmd). The same ideas about memory systems, retrieval vs retention, and context management apply here. Personal knowledge management is fundamentally about external memory. AI agents just make that external memory system more usable.

::: callout-tip
## Why Local AI?

Running AI models locally gives you control over your data, no API costs for high-frequency queries, and the ability to customize models for your specific workflow. You can fine-tune on your own notes, experiment with prompts without worrying about costs, and keep sensitive client information on your own hardware.

The tradeoff? You need decent hardware (I'm running on a machine with a capable GPU) and some technical setup. There's a learning curve. But for anyone already comfortable with Docker and basic ML concepts, it's manageable.

If local hosting isn't practical, you can use cloud APIs. The patterns are the same. You just trade control for convenience.
:::

Let me break down the specific agents I'm running.

## Four Agents That Actually Solve Problems

These aren't sentient AIs. They're specialized tools that automate specific tasks I used to do manually. Each one solves a real problem I was facing.

### Agent 1: Async Research Agent

**What it does:** Automated research that deposits findings directly into my vault.

I give it research questions or topics I need to understand. "What are the current best practices for multi-region Azure deployments?" or "Who is this company and what should I know before our meeting?" It searches, reads, synthesizes, and creates organized notes in a designated folder for my review.

The process is asynchronous. I queue up research tasks in the morning, and by afternoon there are draft notes waiting. I review them, verify the information, integrate what's useful, and discard what isn't.

**Real use cases:** - Preparing for client conversations with new companies or industries - Technology evaluation and comparison - Blog post research (including this post, to be honest)

**Honest assessment:** The quality varies. Sometimes it nails exactly what I needed. Sometimes it goes off on tangents or misses the point. I always verify the information before trusting it. But it saves hours of initial research grunt work. It's best for breadth, not depth. It gives me enough context to ask better questions and dig deeper where it matters.

### Agent 2: Linting and Metadata Agent

**What it does:** Maintains hygiene in my knowledge vault.

This is the unglamorous agent. It scans for uncataloged notes (no tags, missing metadata, orphaned from the graph). It suggests tags based on content analysis. It identifies broken links. It flags notes I haven't touched in months that might be stale or outdated.

I run it weekly. It generates a report of vault health issues, and I spend 30 minutes cleaning up. Without this agent, the vault would slowly decay into an unsearchable mess.

**Real use cases:** - Preventing vault decay over time - Maintaining discoverability of older notes - Reducing cognitive debt from disorganized information

**Honest assessment:** This is like having a librarian for your brain. Not exciting, but essential. It prevents the "I know I wrote about this somewhere but I can't find it" problem. The time investment pays off every time I search for something and actually find it quickly because the tags and structure are maintained.

### Agent 3: Goal Alignment Agent

**What it does:** Keeps my daily work connected to my longer-term objectives.

This is the agent that makes me uncomfortable, which probably means it's working.

I have notes for yearly goals, quarterly priorities, monthly focuses, and weekly targets. This agent reads all of them, analyzes my recent daily notes to see what I've actually been working on, and generates daily reminders about alignment or misalignment.

It's not subtle. "You said Q1 priority was growing the data platform practice, but you've spent the last three days on internal tooling." Sometimes I have good reasons for the mismatch. Often I don't.

**Real use cases:** - Running a business with multiple side projects means it's easy to drift - Acts as an accountability partner - Helps with strategic time allocation

**A real example:** In November, I had committed to writing two blog posts and preparing for a conference talk. My goal agent, after analyzing two weeks of daily notes, pointed out I'd written zero words on any post and hadn't opened my slide deck once. Instead, I'd gone deep on a client project that was interesting but not strategic.

I was annoyed. Then I adjusted. That's when the system works.

**Honest assessment:** Sometimes it's uncomfortably accurate. It requires good goal documentation to be useful. If you don't write down what matters, it can't tell you when you're off track. And not everyone wants this level of tracking. If you're allergic to quantified self concepts, you'll hate this agent.

::: callout-important
## The Goal Alignment Feedback Loop

**Week 1:** Agent tells me I'm off track. **Week 2:** I ignore it because I'm "busy." **Week 3:** Agent's report shows I've made zero progress on a Q1 priority. **Week 4:** I finally adjust.

The system works when you listen to it. If you ignore the signal, it's just noise.
:::

### Agent 4: Agentic RAG for Note Querying

**What it does:** Intelligent retrieval and synthesis across my entire vault.

This is the "search my brain" agent. Natural language queries that go beyond keyword matching. "What have I learned about agentic patterns over the last six months?" It retrieves relevant notes, synthesizes insights across multiple sources, and provides a coherent summary with references.

It's not just search. It's context-aware retrieval. It understands that my note about a client meeting might be relevant to a technical question because of a connection I made in a different note.

I also use it for content generation. Writing this post, I queried my vault for everything I've written about productivity, tools, and knowledge management. It pulled together fragments from dozens of notes across 14 months. That became the foundation for the personal stories and examples here.

**Real use cases:** - "Find all my notes related to client X and summarize key decisions" - "What have I written about Azure deployment patterns?" - "Show me all unresolved questions I've tagged in the last month" - Using my own knowledge base as a foundation for new research and writing

**Honest assessment:** This agent is only as good as the notes you've written. Garbage in, garbage out. If you don't write clear, well-structured notes, the retrieval won't be useful. But if you maintain decent notes, the experience of asking your own knowledge base questions and getting thoughtful answers is remarkable.

As I wrote in my [agentic patterns post](../agentic-patterns-right-now-2025/index.qmd), the shift from retention to retrieval is fundamental. You don't need to remember everything. You need to be able to find and use what you've captured. This agent makes that practical.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Four agents. Four distinct problems solved. None of them are sentient. None of them are magic. But together, they've turned Obsidian from a productivity system into a thinking partner.

## Beyond the Hype: Personal Knowledge Management as an Agentic Pattern

Both knowledge graphs and agentic AI have hype problems. Knowledge graphs were supposed to revolutionize how we think. Agentic AI is supposed to replace knowledge workers. Most of the hype is nonsense.

But both deliver real utility when you actually do the work.

Personal knowledge management plus AI agents is a genuinely practical use case for agentic systems. Not because it's flashy. Because it's bounded, constrained, and human-in-the-loop by design.

**Why this works when other agentic hype doesn't:**

1.  **Bounded domain.** This isn't an agent trying to do everything. It's agents working within a specific, limited context: your notes.

2.  **High signal-to-noise ratio.** These are your notes. You wrote them. There's no garbage data to filter, no adversarial inputs to defend against. The agents are working with curated, high-quality information.

3.  **Clear success metrics.** Can you find what you wrote? Can you use it to do better work? Can you make connections you wouldn't make otherwise? Success is obvious.

4.  **Human-in-the-loop by design.** These agents don't make decisions. They surface information, suggest organization, point out misalignments. You still do the thinking.

5.  **Fails gracefully.** If an agent makes a mistake, nothing breaks. Bad note organization doesn't crash production systems. You just fix the tags and move on.

In my [agentic patterns post](../agentic-patterns-right-now-2025/index.qmd), I wrote about memory as a system design problem. How do you keep useful context across sessions? Personal knowledge management is fundamentally about external memory and retrieval. These agents solve the meta-cognitive problems: organization, alignment, synthesis.

They're not autonomous agents running wild. They're specialized sub-agents doing narrow, predictable, repeatable tasks. Exactly the pattern that works in production systems.

This is what makes PKM plus AI different from productivity theater. It's not about building a beautiful system. It's about building a system that reduces cognitive load so you can focus on the work that actually matters.

::: callout-note
## The Pattern That Matters

Knowledge graphs + AI isn't about building a magical all-knowing system. It's about:

1.  Externalizing your thinking
2.  Using AI to maintain and query that external memory
3.  Keeping yourself in the loop
4.  Building slowly over time

This is what "agentic PKM" actually means in practice. Not hype. Just engineering discipline applied to knowledge work.
:::

## When Second Brains + AI Make Sense (And When They Don't)

Let's be clear about who this is for. I'm not selling you on this system. I'm telling you when it might be worth the investment.

**This makes sense if:**

-   You're managing high cognitive load. Multiple projects, clients, or domains that you need to keep separate but accessible.
-   You context switch frequently. Moving between different types of work, different stakeholders, different mental models.
-   You do knowledge work professionally. Writing, designing, architecture, consulting, research. Work where building on past knowledge creates compounding value.
-   You're willing to invest time building the system. This isn't plug-and-play. It takes weeks to build useful structure and months to see real returns.
-   You're technical enough to set up local AI, or willing to learn. If Docker and Python don't scare you, you can do this. If they do, you'll need to use cloud APIs and accept less control.

**This doesn't make sense if:**

-   Your work doesn't require much external memory. If you're doing the same work repeatedly with little variation, you don't need elaborate knowledge systems.
-   You prefer working in the moment without documentation. Some people think best by not looking back. That's valid. This system isn't for you.
-   You don't have time for system maintenance. If you can't commit to at least 30 minutes per day on notes and review, the system will degrade quickly.
-   You're looking for a magic productivity solution. This isn't magic. It's work. If you're hoping a tool will fix productivity problems that are really about focus or prioritization, this won't help.

**The real benefit isn't productivity theater:**

This isn't about feeling organized. It's not about building a beautiful vault to show off. It's about cognitive offloading that actually works. When your working memory is freed from remembering context, you can use it for thinking.

Combining structured thinking (Obsidian) with computational assistance (AI agents) lets you build knowledge systems that genuinely augment how you work. Not replace. Augment.

For me, running my own business with half a dozen side projects would be impossible without this system. Not because it makes me superhuman. It offloads just enough cognitive overhead that I can focus on the work that matters.

**Looking forward:**

This is still early days for agentic personal knowledge management. Tools will improve. Patterns will stabilize. We'll figure out what works and what's just hype.

But the core idea is sound. Externalized thinking plus AI assistance is a genuine augmentation of human cognition. Build your system slowly. Iterate. Find what works for you.

It's not a second brain. It's a thinking partner. And with AI agents handling the meta-work, it's finally worth the investment.
