So in case you didn't know I attended SQLBITS 2025 last month and presented a talk entitled Danger In Dialogue: The Security Risks of Large Language Models.

It's the 3rd SQLBITS I've spoken at and the 4th i've attended. I've not been that active this year on the conference/group/talk circuit. I've just been busy, deflated and working on AI side projects.

I love getting to see friends, old and current collegues along with seeing people talk about stuff. I mean I do a lot of reading in my life and I do just love seeing passionate people talk about stuff that matters them and me!

I wanted to post this note to say, I've actually written maybe 30 blog posts over the last two years that never made the cut to go live. I really need to get better at hitting publish and maybe not holding myself to the same standard as those who's blogs I read a lot. Only by doing more of this, can I achieve those standards. Nearly doing them is a poor attempt at avoiding feedback.

You will see a slow drip feed of posts over the next few days. For now I'd like to highlight two recent posts:
