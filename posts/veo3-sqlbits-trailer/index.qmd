So incase you didn't know I attended SQLBITS 2025 earlier this year and presented a talk entitled Danger In Dialogue: The Security Risks of Large Language Models.

So in the run up to SQLBITS I released a trailer for my talk on the danger of LLMs. You can see it here.



Now as part of this work, I wanted to use the latest in image generation for research. Also as dyposian as it is, it's really kinda cool. Now the world has moved on since then with the rise of OpenAI's SORA. I however wanted to talk about the trial and error prompting that worked for me with VEO3.

## My side question for access at Launch.
My quest to get access at launch was quite an adventure. VEO3 launched only in the US, requiring the expensive Ultra plan and a US-based Google account. Creating a new account was easy, but verifying a US address proved tricky. Prepaid debit cards with US addresses were screened out, so that option was out.

Google Play Cards were accepted, but only US-based ones. I dusted off my old Amazon.com account to buy $200 worth of Google Play Cards, but the order was flagged as suspicious—Amazon thought I was a victim of a gift card scam and cancelled it. I tried again, even contacting support and explaining I was traveling to New York and needed the cards, but the suspicious activity couldn’t be overridden.

I checked every major retailer Target, Walmart, and more but had no luck. Eventually, I found a gift card site that had what I needed. Early in the morning, I completed my purchase and tried to top up my new Google account. Unfortunately, my account was flagged as suspicious, requiring me to submit a form for each gift card for manual review by Google staff, with a response expected in a few days.

A few days pass and they reject the giftcards and I need to resubmit with more evidence.  Then the next day the plan launched in the UK, I bought it and never used those giftcards.
