*This is part of [The AIOps Journey](../aiops-journey-what-is-it/index.qmd) series, exploring the operational challenges of AI at scale.*

## Overview

If your AI risk strategy begins and ends with "what could AI do to us," you're only seeing a quarter of the picture.

**AI risk** is not a technical footnote for the security team. It is a strategic business concern that belongs in the boardroom alongside market risk, regulatory risk, and operational risk. With the EU AI Act imposing penalties up to 7% of global revenue for serious violations, and [93% of security leaders](https://blog.checkpoint.com/research/ai-security-report-2025-understanding-threats-and-building-smarter-defenses/) bracing for daily AI-enabled attacks, the stakes are no longer hypothetical.

Yet most organizations approach AI risk one-dimensionally.

They focus on the obvious hallucinations, bias, deepfakes aka the threats that **AI systems pose to us**. That's important, but it's only one quadrant of the picture. What about threats directed **at your AI systems**? What about the **risk of not adopting AI** while competitors race ahead? What about the **liability from your own AI adoption** creates?

These aren't edge cases. They're the other 75% of your risk landscape that goes unmanaged when you treat AI risk as a single category.

The framework I use breaks AI risk into four distinct quadrants, each demanding different mitigation strategies, different stakeholders, and different investment priorities. Together they form a comprehensive view that gives leaders the vocabulary to make informed trade-offs rather than reactive decisions.

Let's examine each quadrant in detail.

## Threats FROM AI Models

These are risks posed by AI capabilities being used against you or others. AI-powered cyberattacks are increasingly sophisticated. Deepfakes can enable social engineering at unprecedented scale. Autonomous agents can be weaponized. The same technologies helping organizations improve efficiency are being co-opted by threat actors.

According to [Checkpoint's AI Security Report 2025](https://blog.checkpoint.com/research/ai-security-report-2025-understanding-threats-and-building-smarter-defenses/), 93% of security leaders are bracing for daily AI-enabled attacks. This isn't a future concern, it's reality.

## Threats TO AI Models

Your AI systems themselves are attack surfaces. Data poisoning can corrupt training data and degrade model performance. Adversarial inputs can manipulate model outputs. Model theft exposes your intellectual property. Prompt injection can hijack LLM-based applications.

Frameworks like [MITRE ATLAS](https://atlas.mitre.org/) provide a structured taxonomy of these threats, similar to how MITRE ATT&CK maps traditional cyber threats. If you're familiar with ATT&CK, ATLAS provides a complementary view specifically for AI systems.

## Threats from NOT Using AI Models

There's a risk to inaction. Organizations that fail to adopt AI effectively face competitive disadvantage, operational inefficiency, and missed opportunities. While your competitors use AI to accelerate product development, improve customer experience, and optimize operations, standing still means falling behind.

The McKinsey data on the gap between AI adoption and AI value is telling here. The organiations seeing real returns aren't just experimenting with AI. They're operationalising it effectively. They're redesigning workflows, not just adding AI as a feature.

## Threats USING AI Models

Finally, there are risks from your own AI adoption. Hallucinations can lead to wrong decisions. Bias in models can create legal and ethical exposure. Compliance violations around data privacy and AI governance are increasingly costly, with the EU AI Act imposing penalties up to 7% of global revenue for serious violations.

This is where operational rigor matters most. Without proper monitoring, testing, and governance, your AI initiatives can create as many problems as they solve.

## Bringing It Together

These four quadrants aren't independent. They interact in complex ways:

-   Defending against threats FROM AI often requires using AI yourself (fighting fire with fire)
-   Protecting your models (threats TO) while still using them effectively (threats USING) requires careful balance
-   Moving too slowly to avoid risks USING AI creates risks from NOT using AI
-   Your defensive AI capabilities can themselves become attack surfaces

Effective AIOps requires visibility across all four quadrants and the ability to make informed trade-offs between them. In future posts, we'll explore specific strategies for each quadrant and how to build an integrated risk management approach.
